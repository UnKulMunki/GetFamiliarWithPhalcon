# GetFamiliarWithPhalcon

I have built a basic contact list web app using Phalcon PHP.
The point of this excercise is to walk through the initial creation, functionality , MVC structure (as a whole) and basic view creation using the Volt engine with Phalcon PHP. While this initial version uses new URI endpoints for each action on the contacts, I will be continuing to play with partial templates and ajax updates in future versions. 
The end goal is to be able to recommend Development Processes & Patterns that will have a high maintainability, and yet still produce a responsive application core, with solid User Experience as a priority.

Enjoy.
